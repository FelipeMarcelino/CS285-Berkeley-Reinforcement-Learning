This repository contains notes about class CS285(Deep Reinforcement Learning) and homeworks with solutions. 

In this repository you can explenations on the algorithms used, full implementation code, results and how to reproduce the results shown.

The base code of this repository is from: https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework_fall2019. The code written here heavely relies on that repository. The homework included in the repo:

1. Behavioral Cloning
